Description: RegioneReloaded is a package that allows simultaneous analysis of associations between genomic region sets, enabling clustering of data and the creation of ready-to-publish graphs. It takes over and expands on all the features of its predecessor regioneR. It also incorporates a strategy to improve p-value calculations and normalize z-scores coming from multiple analysis to allow for their direct comparison. RegioneReloaded builds upon regioneR by adding new plotting functions for obtaining publication-ready graphs.
